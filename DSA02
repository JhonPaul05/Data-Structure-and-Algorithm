This code is designed to solve a set of mathematical expressions for x values ranging from 1 to 50, plot the results on individual graphs, and save the answers to a txt file. The code also includes user interaction features to allow the user to select specific problems to view or display all of them in one graph.

It generates a list of x values from 1 to 50 to use as inputs for the expressions.
It calculates and stores the results of each expression for all x values in a list.
It plots individual graphs for each expression showing the relationship between x and y values.
It saves the results of all expressions to a txt file named 'results.txt'.
It prompts the user to choose which specific problem to display or to display all problems in one graph. image image image
